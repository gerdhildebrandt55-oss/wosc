<br/>

<p>• Gen 13 Legendary <strong>Lancer</strong> support hero who mixes control, poison-style damage and protection.
<br/>

<p>• Works best in mixed <strong>Infantry + Lancer</strong> marches and coordinated alliance rallies.
<br/>

<p>• She does not carry by herself, but she makes your whole team deal more damage and take less.
</p>
<p><strong>📊 Key Stats (max)</strong>
<br/>

<p>• Exploration: <strong>ATK 4338 / DEF 4338 / HP 43380</strong>
<br/>

<p>• Expedition: <strong>Lethality 405% / Health 405%</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>🛠 Exploration Skills</strong>
<br/>

<p>1) <strong>Envelopment</strong> – Summons a fast-moving vine that hits an area for Attack×100/110/120/130/140% Area Damage and <strong>stuns</strong> the target for 2 seconds.
<br/>

<p>2) <strong>Rosebloom</strong> – Throws toxic Adoria blooms into the target area, dealing area damage and summoning a flesh-eating Adoria Rose that inherits a portion of Flora's attributes and attacks nearby enemies.
<br/>

<p>3) <strong>Nature's Strength</strong> – Flora and her summoned plants gain +2/4/6/8/10% Health and +4/8/12/16/20% Defense, making your frontline significantly harder to kill.
</p>
<p><strong>⚔️ Expedition Skills (Troop Battles)</strong>
<br/>

<p>1) <strong>Enmiring Vines</strong> – Covers the ground with sharp vines; enemies have a chance to suffer increased Damage Taken by 10/20/30/40/50%. This helps your whole team hit harder.
<br/>

<p>2) <strong>Plantage</strong> – Reduces Infantry Damage Taken by 5/10/15/20/25%, and joint attacks from Lancers and roses deal 5/10/15/20/25% extra damage.
<br/>

<p>3) <strong>Confusion Pollen</strong> – Hallucinatory pollen makes enemy Infantry take more damage and reduces enemy Marksmen Damage Dealt by 6/12/18/24/30% for 2 turns every 4 turns. At max level, enemy front gets weaker while their backline hits noticeably softer.
</p>
<p><strong>🎯 How to use Flora</strong>
<br/>

<p>• She is a <strong>support Lancer</strong>, not a pure DPS. Her value is in debuffs and protection.
<br/>

<p>• Great in marches where you mix strong Infantry and Lancers, especially when your alliance plays coordinated rallies.
<br/>

<p>• In Bear Hunt she can help as a support hero, but pure damage leaders usually outperform her as rally leaders. Use her if your team lacks debuffs.
</p>
<p><strong>💰 F2P / Low Spender Tips</strong>
<br/>

<p>• Main sources: <strong>Hall of Heroes</strong>, mythic general shards and later the <strong>Foundry Shop</strong>.
<br/>

<p>• Aim for <strong>1–3 stars</strong> first; this already unlocks her important expedition debuffs.
<br/>

<p>• Focus on <strong>Enmiring Vines</strong> and <strong>Confusion Pollen</strong> – more Damage Taken on enemies and reduced Marksmen damage are always useful.
</p>
<p><strong>💳 P2W / Heavy Spender Tips</strong>
<br/>

<p>• Very strong when combined with good Lancer gear and strong DPS partners.
<br/>

<p>• In capital and SVS her debuffs shine in mixed marches with a solid tank and heavy backline damage.
<br/>

<p>• Synergizes extremely well with Vulcanus – she increases Damage Taken, he punishes with massive burst.
</p>
<p><strong>🤓 Beginner vs. Advanced Tips</strong>
<br/>

<p>• <strong>Beginners:</strong> Build Flora after you have at least one solid tank (for example Gisela) and one reliable DPS hero.
<br/>

<p>• <strong>Advanced players:</strong> Use her in your top 1–3 marches and keep her alive; her debuffs scale with your entire alliance damage in large rallies.
