<br/>

<p>• Class: Marksman (Combat)
<br/>

<p>• Best role: Arena backline carry + team support (cleanse + anti-heal + damage buffs)
<br/>

<p>• Shard sources: Lucky Wheel (main) + event deals (server-dependent)
</p>
<p>🛡️ Core kit (what her skills do)
<br/>

<p>• Hymn of Sidrak (Exploration): Cleanses all debuffs (Freeze, Stun, etc.) from all troops, then increases all troops’ Attack by 3%/4%/5%/6%/7% for 3/3.5/4/4.5/5s and makes them immune to debuffs during that time.
<br/>

<p>• Lethal Finale (Exploration): Fires a penetrating shot, dealing Attack*220%/240%/260%/280%/300% damage to enemies along the path.
<br/>

<p>• Discordant Tune (Exploration): Reduces enemy troops’ Attack Speed by 1%/1.5%/2%/2.5%/3% and reduces Healing effects by 40%/45%/50%/55%/60%.
<br/>

<p>• Song of Lion (Exploration): Grants all troops a 40% chance to increase damage dealt by 10%/20%/30%/40%/50%.
<br/>

<p>• Melancholic Ballad (Exploration): Reduces damage dealt by all enemy troops by 4%/8%/12%/16%/20%.
<br/>

<p>• Oonai Cadenza (Exploration): Increases Lynn’s Marksmen Attack by 1%/2%/3%/4%/5% for every 3 attacks. Stackable and lasts until the end of battle.
<br/>

<p>• Exclusive Weapon: Ella’s Tear (Widgets 5/10/15/20/25/30/35/40/45/50)
<br/>

<p>– Aira’s Elegy: After casting “Hymn of Sidrak”, Lynn gains +15% Attack until the end of the battle.
<br/>

<p>– Iranon’s Determination: Increases Defender Troops’ Lethality by 15%.
</p>
<p>🔥 Strengths
<br/>

<p>• Debuff cleanse + immunity window: huge value vs Freeze/Stun comps and in Arena timing fights.
<br/>

<p>• Strong anti-heal: Discordant Tune reduces enemy healing significantly.
<br/>

<p>• Teamwide damage swing: Song of Lion (chance-based) + Melancholic Ballad (flat enemy damage reduction).
<br/>

<p>• F2P-friendly access: Lucky Wheel shards make her realistically obtainable to 4★–5★ over time.
</p>
<p>⚠️ Weaknesses
<br/>

<p>• RNG component: Song of Lion is chance-based; impact can vary per fight.
<br/>

<p>• Needs a proper frontline: she is not a tank; pair with durable Infantry.
<br/>

<p>• Best value when your march uses Marksmen and fights last long enough for stacking buffs.
</p>
<p>🎯 Best use (practical)
<br/>

<p>• Arena: one of the strongest Gen 4 backliners thanks to cleanse + anti-heal + damage control.
<br/>

<p>• Exploration stages: line shot + debuff management helps stabilize difficult waves.
<br/>

<p>• Defense/holding: Defender Lethality from her Exclusive Weapon is valuable if you invest.
</p>
<p>📈 Upgrade priorities (simple)
<br/>

<p>1) Stars: aim 3★–4★ quickly; 5★ is a long-term goal (Wheel).
<br/>

<p>2) Skills: prioritize Hymn of Sidrak and Discordant Tune for the biggest match impact.
<br/>

<p>3) Exclusive Weapon: unlock (5 widgets) if you use her often; milestones add consistent power.
<br/>

<p>4) Gear: Marksman Attack/Lethality first; then survivability (Health/Defense) if she dies too fast.
</p>
<p>💎 F2P vs P2W
<br/>

<p>• F2P: focus Lucky Wheel spins; build to 4★; grab Exclusive Weapon if Lynn is your main Arena backline.
<br/>

<p>• P2W: push 5★ + higher Exclusive Weapon milestones to maximize uptime and team advantage.
</p>
<p>✅ TL;DR
<br/>

<p>Lynn is a Generation 4 Legendary Marksman built for Arena dominance and team support: cleanse + debuff immunity, strong anti-heal, and teamwide damage control.
