<br/>

<p>• Gen 13 Legendary <strong>Marksman</strong> hero with extremely high damage and strong debuffs.
<br/>

<p>• Very fragile by himself, but one of the strongest damage dealers of this generation if protected properly.
<br/>

<p>• Key hero for high-level rallies, capital fights and state-versus-state wars.
</p>
<p><strong>📊 Key Stats (max)</strong>
<br/>

<p>• Exploration: <strong>ATK 5263 / DEF 4338 / HP 32535</strong>
<br/>

<p>• Expedition: <strong>Lethality 405% / Health 405%</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>🛠 Exploration Skills</strong>
<br/>

<p>1) <strong>Siege Bolts</strong> – Fires three heavy bolts that shred defenses, dealing very high damage and inflicting Bleed. <strong>Bleed:</strong> deals Attack×10% damage every 0.5s for 3 seconds by default.
<br/>

<p>2) <strong>Chainlinked</strong> – Targets an enemy hero with a chained dart, dealing Attack×100/110/120/130/140% damage and immobilizing / stunning the target for 2 seconds.
<br/>

<p>3) <strong>Fire of Hope</strong> – Converts fury into discipline, increasing his escort troops' Attack by 10/15/20/25/30% and Defense by 10/15/20/25/30%. His exclusive upgrades can push Bleed up to Attack×20% every 0.5s for 3s.
</p>
<p><strong>⚔️ Expedition Skills (Troop Battles)</strong>
<br/>

<p>1) <strong>Raging Storm</strong> – Reduces all enemy troops' Attack by 4/8/12/16/20%. This makes enemy rallies hit noticeably softer.
<br/>

<p>2) <strong>Breaker Steel</strong> – After every 5 attacks, your troops deal extra damage and the target suffers additional Damage Taken of 5/7.5/10/12.5/15% on the next hit.
<br/>

<p>3) <strong>True Strike</strong> – Vulcanus' armor-piercing arrows greatly reduce the Defense of enemy Infantry and Lancers and increase your Marksmen's Attack by 12/24/36/48/60% for 1 turn. At max level, your main damage line gets a huge spike.
</p>
<p><strong>🎯 How to use Vulcanus</strong>
<br/>

<p>• One of the top <strong>damage + debuff</strong> heroes of Gen 13 – ideal for your main damage march.
<br/>

<p>• Amazing in capital fights, SVS and big alliance rallies, especially when combined with strong tanks and supports.
<br/>

<p>• From <strong>4★ and higher</strong>, he is an excellent <strong>Bear Hunt rally leader</strong>: he boosts Rally Attack, applies strong debuffs and deals massive personal damage.
</p>
<p><strong>💰 F2P / Low Spender Tips</strong>
<br/>

<p>• Main sources: <strong>Lucky Wheel</strong>, mythic general hero shards and later the <strong>Foundry Shop</strong>.
<br/>

<p>• Reaching very high stars without spending is hard; realistic first step is <strong>1–3 stars</strong>.
<br/>

<p>• Even at lower stars he is worth putting into your best damage march thanks to his skills.
</p>
<p><strong>💳 P2W / Heavy Spender Tips</strong>
<br/>

<p>• One of the <strong>best investments</strong> among Gen 13 heroes.
<br/>

<p>• If your alliance plays many rallies and Bear Hunts, aim to push him to <strong>4★+</strong> quickly.
<br/>

<p>• Combine him with support heroes that increase Damage Taken (like Flora) and tanks that keep him safe (like Gisela).
</p>
<p><strong>🤓 Beginner vs. Advanced Tips</strong>
<br/>

<p>• <strong>Beginners:</strong> Do not make him your very first project – build at least one solid tank first, then focus on Vulcanus as main DPS.
<br/>

<p>• <strong>Advanced players:</strong> Always place him in the <strong>back row</strong> of your top damage march with ATK/Crit badges. Use him as primary rally leader for serious PvP/Bear once he reaches 4★ or more.
