<br/>

<p>• Gen 13 Legendary <strong>Infantry</strong> hero focused on shields and keeping your march alive.
<br/>

<p>• Best position: <strong>front row</strong> in every serious march (capital, SVS, big city rallies).
<br/>

<p>• Very safe pick for players who prefer stable marches over risky glass-cannon setups.
</p>
<p><strong>📊 Key Stats (max)</strong>
<br/>

<p>• Exploration: <strong>ATK 3325 / DEF 4338 / HP 65070</strong>
<br/>

<p>• Expedition: <strong>Lethality 405% / Health 405%</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>🛠 Exploration Skills</strong>
<br/>

<p>1) <strong>Superload</strong> – For 5 seconds she gains 50 Energy, Attack Speed +20/30/40/50/60% and Defense +50/75/100/125/150%. This makes her much harder to kill during the burst window.
<br/>

<p>2) <strong>Steel Hammer</strong> – Area attack that deals Attack×100/110/120/130/140% damage and gives 25 Energy, helping her reach the shield faster.
<br/>

<p>3) <strong>Porta-Shield</strong> – When she reaches 100 Energy she creates a mini shield equal to Attack×70/100/130/160/190% for 3 seconds. Each Normal Attack gives 3/6/9/12/15 Energy, so at higher skill levels the shield appears more often and gets stronger. Her exclusive upgrades can further boost the shield up to Attack×190% and add extra Energy per hit.
</p>
<p><strong>⚔️ Expedition Skills (Troop Battles)</strong>
<br/>

<p>1) <strong>Alloyed Defense</strong> – Increases Infantry Defense by 6/12/18/24/30%. Simple but very strong for any infantry-heavy march.
<br/>

<p>2) <strong>Scavengeworks</strong> – Infantry under Gisela have a chance (up to about 40% at higher levels) to increase all troops' Defense by 10/20/30/40/50% for 1 turn. This helps your march survive enemy burst damage in capital fights and SVS.
<br/>

<p>3) <strong>Trial Shield</strong> – Sometimes gives all troops a shield effect that reduces Damage Taken by 10/20/30/40/50% for 1 turn. When this procs at the right moment, it can completely change the result of a rally.
</p>
<p><strong>🎯 How to use Gisela</strong>
<br/>

<p>• She wins fights by <strong>not dying</strong> and letting your high-damage heroes work safely behind her.
<br/>

<p>• Perfect in marches that already have strong Marksmen and Lancers – she protects, they kill.
<br/>

<p>• In Bear Hunt she is a <strong>safe frontline hero</strong>, but in most cases another high damage hero should be the rally leader while Gisela sits in a side march or supports the main march as a tank.
</p>
<p><strong>💰 F2P / Low Spender Tips</strong>
<br/>

<p>• Realistic target is <strong>1–3 stars</strong> from events, Daily Deals, Hall of Chiefs and later the Foundry Shop.
<br/>

<p>• Level her <strong>Expedition skills first</strong>, because they help you in every troop battle (PvP and PvE).
<br/>

<p>• Do not throw all shards into her too early. A balanced team of several good heroes is stronger than one maxed tank with weak partners.
</p>
<p><strong>💳 P2W / Heavy Spender Tips</strong>
<br/>

<p>• Great investment once you already own some top damage dealers.
<br/>

<p>• High-star Gisela makes your Infantry line extremely hard to break in capital fights and SVS.
<br/>

<p>• Works very well with defensive badges, HP/Defense widgets and gear that boosts Damage Reduction.
</p>
<p><strong>🤓 Beginner vs. Advanced Tips</strong>
<br/>

<p>• <strong>Beginners:</strong> Gisela is an easy-to-use first Gen 13 tank – put her in front, give her defensive badges and let her simply stand there and soak damage.
<br/>

<p>• <strong>Advanced players:</strong> Keep her in your <strong>top 1–2 marches</strong> for capital/SVS. Only swap her out in easy farm hits where you want greedy, full-damage setups instead of maximum safety.
